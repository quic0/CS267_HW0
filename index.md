## About Me
My name is Quico Spaen. I am a third year PhD student in the department of
Industrial Engineering & Operations Research at UC Berkeley as well as a MSc student in
Computer Science. My research focuses on algorithms for combinatorial
optimization and Machine Learning. Currently I am working on solving a medical imaging
problem in neuroscience with algorithms from combinatorial optimization and
on the development of Bayesian optimization methods for Deep Learning.

In my free time I enjoy cycling, other outdoor activities, and good food.
