## About Me
My name is Quico Spaen. I am a third year PhD student in the department of Industrial Engineering & Operations Research at UC Berkeley as well as a MSc student in Computer Science. My research focuses on algorithms for combinatorial optimization and Machine Learning. Currently I am working on solving a medical imaging problem in neuroscience with algorithms from combinatorial optimization and on the development of Bayesian optimization methods for Deep Learning. Furthermore, I am interested in transportation related topics.

In my free time I enjoy cycling, other outdoor activities, and good food.

## Parallel algorithms in combinatorial optimization
Combinatorial optimization involves finding the best solution from a countable (typically finite) set. Combinatorial optimization is typically much harder than continuous (convex) optimization. Within combinatorial optimization there are many famous problems such as the [Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP)](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Travelling_salesman_problem).
